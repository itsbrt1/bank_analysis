#####Project Overview

This end-to-end Bank Analytics project analyzes customer financial behavior by integrating a Banking Loan Dataset with a Credit/Debit Transaction Dataset. The project focuses on identifying factors that influence loan approvals, understanding spending and transaction patterns, and assessing customer risk levels. Dashboards built using Excel, Power BI, Tableau, along with SQL-based analysis, provide insights into customer segmentation, loan performance, and transaction trends, supporting data-driven decision-making for financial institutions.


######Tools & Technologies

A multi-tool analytics approach was used to ensure comprehensive analysis. Power BI and Tableau were utilized to create interactive dashboards with advanced visualizations and drill-downs. Excel supported pivot-based summaries and quick reporting, while SQL was used for data cleaning, exploration, and analytical querying. Together, these tools form a complete end-to-end analytics workflow.


######Dataset Description

The project is based on two structured datasets. The Banking Loan Dataset includes customer details such as age, income, employment type, credit score, loan amount, marital status, and loan approval status. The Credit/Debit Transaction Dataset contains transaction-level information, including customer ID, transaction type, amount, merchant category, timestamps, and spending behavior. Due to confidentiality requirements, the original datasets are not publicly shared; however, dashboards, analysis results, and documentation are included in the repository.


######Key Insights

The analysis shows that customers with higher credit scores and stable income patterns have higher loan approval rates. Debit transactions tend to peak on weekends, while credit card usage increases during festival periods. High-risk customers were identified based on low credit scores, irregular spending patterns, and prior loan defaults. The dashboards also highlight spending categories, seasonal trends, repayment behavior, and demographic influences.


######Future Enhancements

Future improvements include integrating machine learning models for loan approval and risk prediction, developing automated ETL pipelines, and enabling real-time transaction monitoring. Additional enhancements may involve Python-based analytics, expanded datasets, and embedding dashboards into a web application for a unified customer financial scoring system.
